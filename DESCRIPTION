Description: Provides functions related to human natural ordering.  It
    handles adjacent digits in a character sequence as a number so
    that natural sort function arranges a character vector by their
    numbers, not digit characters. It is typically seen when operating
    systems lists file names. For example, a sequence a-1.png,
    a-2.png, a-10.png looks naturally ordered because 1 < 2 < 10 and
    natural sort algorithm arranges so whereas general sort algorithms
    arrange it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their third
    and fourth characters.  The package can work with natural numbers,
    integers, real numbers, and scientific notation.
